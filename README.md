This template app was built using Python3, the Flask web framework and Pytest.

### Features
- Users can sign up, sign in and log out
- They can also create, read update and delete (CRUD) posts
- Users have to be signed in to create posts
- Users can only update or delete their own posts

### Design
- posts.py and auth.py are views (the equivalent of Sinatra controllers)
- post.py and user.py are models
- db.py looks after creating the database connection

## Quickstart

To run the server:

```shell
# Set up the database
; FLASK_APP=acebook pipenv run flask init-db

# Run the server
; FLASK_APP=acebook pipenv run flask run
```

To run the tests:

```shell
# Run the tests
# First, set up chromedriver — you'll only need to do this once.
; pipenv run sbase install chromedriver latest

# Then, run the server and keep it running.
; FLASK_APP=acebook pipenv run flask run
# Don't hit ctrl-C — keep it running!

# Finally, in another terminal window, run the tests
; pipenv run pytest
```

Pytest is very similar to `unittest`, but with a nicer display.

## Running the tests
- To run them all `pytest`
- To run the tests in a specific file, e.g. test_auth.py `pytest
  ./tests/test_auth.py`

## Dependency management

To add dependencies, run:

```shell
; pipenv install mydependency
```

## Altering the database

At some point in the not too distant future, you'll want to alter the database
in some way. E.g. By adding a new column to an existing table or by creating a
new table. The simplest way to do this is to edit `schema.sql`, then re-run
`flask init-db`. BUT... this will drop and recreate the existing tables and
you'll lose any data contained within them.
